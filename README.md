# SC_DS_TASK4
This project is part of my internship at Skillcraft Technology (Task 4). It involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of US accidents to uncover patterns and insights related to accident severity, weather conditions, time of day, and geographical distribution. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geospatial visualization to provide actionable insights for road safety.

Dataset

The dataset used is US_Accidents_March23.csv, a large collection of accident records in the United States. It includes features such as accident severity, location (latitude and longitude), weather conditions, time, and road characteristics.

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. It can be downloaded from Kaggle or other relevant sources.

Project Structure





skillinrntask4.py: Main Python script containing the code for data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations.



Accident_Hotspots.html: Output file for the interactive heatmap of accident hotspots (generated by the script).



README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Features and Analysis

The project explores the following patterns and insights:





Severity by Weather: Analyzes how weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog) impact accident severity.



Time of Day: Examines accident frequency by hour to identify peak times.



Weekday Patterns: Investigates accident distribution across days of the week.



Road Conditions: Studies the distribution of accident distances (affected road length).



Visibility Impact: Explores the relationship between visibility and accident severity.



Temperature Impact: Analyzes how temperature correlates with accident severity.



Accident Hotspots: Visualizes high-risk areas using a geospatial heatmap.



Day vs. Night: Compares accident frequency during day (sunrise) and night (sunset).



Correlation Analysis: Examines relationships between numerical features like visibility, wind speed, and precipitation.

Tech Stack





Python: Core programming language.



Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.



NumPy: Numerical operations.



Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization for plots and charts.



Folium: Geospatial visualization for heatmaps.
